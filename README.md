## About Me
Hello there! (General Kenobi...) I am a current WPI undergrad who enjoys the complex problem solving and constant change that robotics brings. My projects utilize a wide range of tools, from robotics with ROS to web development with React. I am currently building my own testing CI/CD workflow for my Discord bots, migrating my robotics projects to ROS 2, and making custom sdf/urdf/xacro robot models for use in Gazebo Sim. In my free time I enjoy playing lacrosse, longboarding, playing bass guitar, and working on the Turtlebot2 I recently aquired.
